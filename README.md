■What is React
 1. Declarative
 2. Component-Based★
  ⇒ Like other all of the major front-end frameworks such as Angular, Vue, you can break out your code into small components.
     It allows us not only write our HTML on how we want it to interact with our state, but it also allows us to manage that state inside of our application.
     
     If you want to change a small bit of it, it is so much easier to make samll incremental changes to your application without having to worry about breaking things outside of the lareger scope of the single component you work on.
     You just remove that component and then add a new component essentially you change only the small thing you want to change and you do not have to mess with changing everything else in your application. Also React allows you to actually rerender your application every time your state changes automatically.
